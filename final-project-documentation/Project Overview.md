- The project name is find-your-bias
- [yashwanth-yasp/find-your-bias: This is a fork of dockersamples/examplevotingapp](https://github.com/yashwanth-yasp/find-your-bias)
- This project uses the docker-samples/voting-app as base 
- The project gets votes from a crowd and analyzes the overall political leaning and echo chamber strength of the crowd. 
- It shows a tweet to the user and gives them a choice to choose if they agree or disagree to the statement. 
- Depending on the results an AI will judge the percentage of political leaning and what the crowd agrees and disagrees on, and tells the user if the crowd is a potential echo chamber feeding on it's own views with no progressive direction. 
- The voting is real time, the results would show as each vote is recorded.
