- Tsetlin machines do exactly what neural networks don't 
- When you get a result, you know exactly what contributed to that result, that's why it is called "explainable"

- The Tsetlin Machine is not just another machine learning algorithm. It draws on principles laid down by [Mikhail Tsetlin](https://www.literal-labs.ai/tsetlin-machines/michael-tsetlin-biography.html), a visionary Soviet mathematician, who in the 1960s explored a radically different path to artificial intelligence. Rather than mimicking biological neurons, Tsetlin’s approach was rooted in learning automata and game theory. He recognised that logic—expressed through what we now call _Tsetlin automata_—could classify data more efficiently, forging a new direction in AI.
- A Tsetlin machine is a field of machine learning algorithms, and associated computational architectures, that uses the principles of learning automata, called Tsetlin automata, and game theory to create logic propositions for the classification of data obtained from the environment surrounding this machine
