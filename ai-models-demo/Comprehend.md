- Amazon **Comprehend** is an **AWS managed Natural Language Processing (NLP) service**. It uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text, without you having to train or maintain your own ML models.
- Think of it like this: you give it a bunch of raw text, and it tells you things like the **language**, the **sentiment** (positive/negative/neutral/mixed), the **key phrases**, the **entities** (people, places, organizations), and even the **topics** across a set of documents.
