- What could cause a crashloopbackoff?
	- Application-Level Failures
		- Uncaught exceptions / fatal errors in the app
		- **Mismatched versions** of dependencies or binaries inside the image.
		- App starts, then immediately exits because the main process finished.
	- Command / EntryPoint Issues
		- Wrong `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` in Dockerfile
	- Liveness Probes Killing Pod
		- A **failing liveness probe** makes Kubelet kill the container repeatedly
	- Resource Limits
		- Container runs out of memory â†’ OOMKilled.
		- CPU throttling can also make app unresponsive, which can trip probes.
	- Init Containers Not Completing
	- Image Issues
